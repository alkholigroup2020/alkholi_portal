# Phase 2 implementation prompt — Public business-card lookup

Implement **Phase 2: Public business-card lookup** in this repository. Complete its code changes, tests, self-review, and documentation; stop before the next phase. This is an implementation request, not a request for another plan.

## Project context

You are working in the Alkholi employee portal repository. Read `AGENTS.md` and `project-docs/security-fix-plan.md` before editing. Inspect the actual checkout; file names below are starting points, not proof that earlier work is present.

The application is a Nuxt 2 monolith with Vue 2 Options API, Vuetify 2, Vuex, English/Arabic translations and RTL layouts. Express APIs are mounted through `nuxt.config.js` server middleware. Microsoft SQL Server holds application and HR data. Features include the portal, administration, business cards, Code of Conduct (CoC), surveys, and daily time reports (DTR).

The security problem is that several APIs execute SQL supplied by the browser, including an unauthenticated public-card endpoint. Other handlers interpolate external values into SQL, and token existence alone does not enforce roles or employee scope. We are replacing these paths gradually with fixed server-owned operations, typed parameters, and server-side authorization.

Phase 1 introduced shared authentication in `server/shared/authorization.js` and services under `server/login/services/`. After successful authentication, `req.auth` supplies the verified employee code, account, domain, session identifier, and token. Reuse this identity; never trust local storage, body fields, or client-side role flags to establish the caller. Preserve login/logout behavior and existing session lifetime.

## Working rules

- Implement only the phase named above. Do not automatically start the next phase.
- First inspect Git status and the previous phase's implementation and verification record. Preserve unrelated user changes. Prior phases must have been tested and accepted: use recorded evidence or the user's explicit confirmation. If evidence is missing, do read-only preparation and ask only for that missing readiness confirmation before modifying the next phase. Do not invent verification.
- Trace every affected frontend caller, response consumer, router mount, and database operation before editing. Use `rg` to find references. Keep frontend and backend changes deployable together.
- Use fixed SQL/procedure names and typed `request.input(...)` parameters with `mssql`. Never accept SQL or database identifiers from clients. An allowlisted resource name must map to fixed server-owned queries; parameterizing values while accepting query text is still unsafe.
- Preserve schema, public URLs, legitimate workflow behavior, response fields needed by consumers, and English/Arabic support. Follow repository formatting and lint rules; use `$t(...)`, `localePath(...)`, and `cursor-pointer` for clickable buttons.
- Inspect database metadata read-only when needed; do not guess procedure signatures or silently truncate values. Keep credentials, tokens, employee records, and connection details out of output and documentation. If definitions are inaccessible, state the precise uncertainty.
- Do not redesign sessions, remove stored passwords, change LDAP certificates, activate unused DTR role flags, overhaul static document access, or redesign background jobs in this task. Record unrelated findings for later.
- The user deploys and verifies on production and accepts planned downtime. Do not deploy, restart their processes, alter live schema/data, send emails, or commit/push as part of this prompt. Prepare a concrete deployment/rollback checklist. Production writes need separately authorized designated test records.
- Do not start the full application against live services merely to test: startup schedules employee synchronization. Automated tests must use mocks or isolated fixtures, never load `.env`, and never import the full server entry point. Prefer pure services and an isolated Express test app.
- Recovery must not re-expose retired SQL endpoints. If verification fails, keep affected functionality under maintenance; restore a known-good release only when it preserves that boundary, otherwise fix forward. Production test-write instructions must include recording previous values and restoring them afterward.

## Phase objective and starting points

Implement Phase 2 only, after Phase 1 has been accepted. Public business-card pages currently send SQL to `POST /business-cards-api/open-sql-call`, which has no authentication. Replace that unrestricted operation while keeping cards public.

Start with `server/businessCards/router/sqlCalls.js`, `server/businessCards/main.js`, `pages/business-card/_bcard.vue`, and every template in `components/businessCards/`. Read public-card consumers to determine the exact fields and data shape they require.

## Required implementation

1. Add `GET /business-cards-api/public-cards/:employeeCode`. Validate the employee identifier against actual schema and existing identifiers, preserving string IDs and leading zeros.
2. Use a fixed parameterized lookup of the published card record. Explicitly select the public fields required by the templates, including each company variant; do not use `SELECT *` or expose management-only/HR fields merely because they exist in the row.
3. Update the public page to use this endpoint and adapt its response consistently. Preserve `/business-card/:id`, localized URLs, existing QR-code destinations, and current card layout selection.
4. Provide translated, controlled states for invalid IDs, missing cards, and service failures. Do not dereference an empty record or show raw SQL errors.
5. Remove the unauthenticated `open-sql-call` route in the same change. Do not leave an alias that executes supplied SQL. Confirm no other caller still depends on it.
6. Leave authenticated generic card SQL endpoints for their scheduled migrations. Keep vCard download links working; the separate vCard handler's SQL audit is Phase 9. Explicitly record that remaining exposure rather than claiming all public-card APIs are secured.

## Acceptance scenarios

- Public access works without a token for every supported company template and custom-card variant.
- Existing links and QR destinations reach the same cards; English/Arabic rendering remains usable.
- Unknown IDs show a not-found state, invalid values produce a controlled client error, and database failures produce a safe service error.
- Mocked injection-like IDs cannot alter query text or expose extra fields.
- Requests to the retired `open-sql-call` endpoint return `404` in the mounted test app.
- Authentication still works and public viewing does not accidentally require business-card administrator membership.

## Required validation and second review

1. Add meaningful regression tests in `tests/security/` that exercise the changed handlers/services and frontend behavior, including the phase-specific cases above. Reuse the existing Node test runner and dependency-injection patterns. Inspect `package.json`: `test:security` currently enumerates files explicitly, so add new test files to the command when necessary.
2. Run `npm run test:security`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`. Fix failures caused by your changes. Verify all new tests actually ran. Report any environmental blocker with the exact command and result; do not describe an unrun check as passed.
3. **Double-check your work after the first implementation and passing tests.** Review the complete diff, including new files, as a reviewer. Trace each request from caller through authentication, role/scope checks, validation, parameter binding, response, and error handling. Check for missed callers, direct-API bypasses, unsafe fallback routes, changed data shapes, broken localization, connection/file cleanup, and race conditions relevant to this phase. Fix findings and rerun affected checks.
4. Independently search for the old calls and unsafe patterns in the affected scope. Verify retired endpoints through isolated HTTP tests, not only text searches. If a legacy endpoint must remain for a later phase, list its callers and residual exposure explicitly.
5. Update `project-docs/security-fix-plan.md` with a separate dated entry and status for this phase. Record API changes, changed areas, actual commands/results, limitations, production smoke-test steps, and rollback/recovery steps. Preserve historical records. Mark **Implemented** when local checks pass; mark **Deployed** or **Verified** only when those events are actually confirmed. Missing database-definition evidence must remain visible.
6. Finish with a concise summary of changes, test results, remaining risks, and the exact production checks the user should perform. Do not claim that the entire SQL/access-control problem is fixed while later phases or required checks remain.

Work through implementation and local verification rather than returning only a proposal. Make routine implementation decisions from the repository and explain material decisions. Ask a focused question only when missing business policy, database facts, or phase-readiness evidence prevents a safe implementation. Stop after this phase.
